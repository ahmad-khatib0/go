- What is a stub?
  A stub is a concrete implementation of another component. Stubs don’t make use of mocking frameworks,
  as they are used by implementation code. They make testing easier and allow us to build code as if 
  the external component were built and implemented. Due to the flexibility of interfaces in Go, 
  stubbed implementations can be easily swapped out for real implementations.

- The feature file describes a part of the functionality required for new users of the 
  BookSwap application:
  • The feature describes the scenario of signing up as a new user of an application.
  • As a background step, the BookSwap application should be up and running. This allows us
    to write an E2E test as we run the entire application and run the test on the side.
  • When the feature is completed, the following functionality will be available:
    . New customers will be able to create user profiles.
    . When their profile is created, the user will see their user summary and receive 
      their user ID, which will allow them to further interact with the application.
    . Once signed up, customers will be able to view their profile by using their user ID.
    . Any further interactions with the application are outside the scope of this feature.
