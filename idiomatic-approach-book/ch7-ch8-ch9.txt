-An abstract type is one that specifies what a type should do, but not how it is done. 
-A concrete type specifies how and what. This means that it has a specified way to store its data and provides an
  implementation of any methods declared on the type. While all types in Go are either abstract or concrete, 
  some languages allow hybrid types, such as abstract classes or interfaces with default methods in Java
