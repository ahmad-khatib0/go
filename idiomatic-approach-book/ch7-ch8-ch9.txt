-An abstract type is one that specifies what a type should do, but not how it is done. 
-A concrete type specifies how and what. This means that it has a specified way to store its data and provides an
  implementation of any methods declared on the type. While all types in Go are either abstract or concrete, 
  some languages allow hybrid types, such as abstract classes or interfaces with default methods in Java

-- By convention, the receiver name (p Person) is a short abbreviation of the type’s name, usually 
   its first letter. It is non-idiomatic to use this or self.
-- Just like functions, method names cannot be overloaded. You can use the same method names for different types, 
   but you can’t use the same method name for two different methods on the same type
