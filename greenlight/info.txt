1- The bin directory will contain our compiled application binaries, ready for deployment to a production server.

2- The cmd/api directory will contain the application-specific code for our Greenlight API application. This 
    will include the code for running the server, reading and writing HTTP requests, and managing authentication.

3- The internal directory will contain various ancillary packages used by our API. It will
    contain the code for interacting with our database, doing data validation, sending emails and so on.
    Basically, any code which isn’t application-specific and can potentially be reused will live in here.
    Our Go code under cmd/api will import the packages in the internal directory (but never the other way around).
    
4- The migrations directory will contain the SQL migration files for our database.

5- The remote directory will contain the configuration files and setup scripts for our production server.

There are two common approaches to do API versioning:
-- 1- By prefixing all URLs with your API version, like /v1/healthcheck or /v2/healthcheck .
-- 2- By using custom Accept and Content-Type headers on requests and responses to
      convey the API version, like Accept: application/vnd.greenlight-v1 .
--  curl -i -X OPTIONS localhost:4000/v1/healthcheck    :will show supported methods for this endpoint
