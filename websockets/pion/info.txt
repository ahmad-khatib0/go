- Renovate is an automated dependency update tool. It helps to update dependencies in your code 
  without needing to do it manually. When Renovate runs on your repo, it looks for references to 
  dependencies (both public and private) and, if there are newer versions available, Renovate can 
  create pull requests to update your versions automatically.
