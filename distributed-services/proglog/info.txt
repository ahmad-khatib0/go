1- each RPC line is an endpoint in that service, The requests 
   and responses are messages that the compiler turns into Go structs,   
2- ConsumeStream—a server-side streaming RPC where the client sends a
   request to the server and gets back a stream to read a sequence of messages
3- ProduceStream—a bidirectional streaming RPC where both the client and
    server send a sequence of messages using a read-write stream. The two
    streams operate independently, so the clients and servers can read and
    write in whatever order they like. For example, the server could wait to
    receive all of the client’s requests before sending back its response. You’d
    order your calls this way if your server needed to process the requests in
    batches or aggregate a response over multiple requests. Alternatively, the
    server could send back a response for each request in lockstep. You’d
    order your calls this way if each request required its own corresponding response.
