GitFlow approach:

•• master: This branch corresponds to the current production code. You can't commit
   directly, except for hotfixes. Git tags can be used to tag all the commits in the master
   branch with a version number (for instance, for using the semantic versioning convention, 
   https://semver.org/, which has three parts: major, minor, and patch, so a tag with version 
   1.2.3 has 1 as its major version, 2 as its minor version, and 3 as its patch version).
    
•• preprod: This is a release branch and is a mirror of production. It can 
   be used to test all the new features that are developed on the develop 
   branch before they are merged to the master branch.
   
•• develop: This is the development integration branch, which contains the latest
   integrated development code.
   
•• feature/X: This is an individual feature branch that's being developed. Each new feature 
   resides in its own branch, and they're generally created for the latest develop branch.
   
•• hotfix/X: When you need to solve something in production code, you can use the
   hotfix branch and open a pull request for the master branch. This branch is based
   on the master branch.
