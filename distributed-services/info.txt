  --- PROTOCOL BUFFERS 
└──────────────────────┘
    Protocol buffers (also known as protobuf), which is Google’s language and platform-neutral extensible 
    mechanism for structur- ing and serializing data. The advantages of using protobuf are that it:
    +----------------------------------+
    | • Guarantees type-safety;        |
    | • Prevents schema-violations;    |
    | • Enables fast serialization;    |
    | • Offers backward compatibility. |
    +----------------------------------+
    Protocol buffers are good for communicating between two systems (such as microservices), 
    which is why Google used protobuf when building gRPC to develop a high-perfor-mance
    remote procedure call (RPC) framework.

--- in proto buffers we specify a package name for two reasons:
      because this protobuf package name is used as the package name in the generated Go code and 
      because it prevents name clashes between protocol message types that have the same name.
